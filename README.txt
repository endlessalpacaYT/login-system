# login-system
a login system with python code

im going to try and create some sort of basic login system with python where we create a script that gets you to create any random account it doesent have to be a real one 
and then saves the information on a text document then whenever you rerun the script you can login more features will be implemented but weve only just started the project

this project was inspired by one of my freinds projects :)

feel free to join in on the project
